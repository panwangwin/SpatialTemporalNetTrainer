## Spatial Temporal Net For Traffic Forecasting
A self developed unified training framework for Spatial Temporal Forecasting. 
It can be used in baseline evaluation and new model development.
There are 3 baseline models are included. 
More models and datasets are in developing progress...  
### Models included now:
* FNN
* Seq2seq with GRU
* DCRNN (Kernel from [3])
### Datasets included now
* Metr-la
